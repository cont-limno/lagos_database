At the Drexel lab, algal isotope filters were fumigated with concentrated HCl to remove carbonates prior to analysis. At the SIRFER lab, samples were analyzed without first fumigating to remove carbonates.","Laboratory data downloaded in the table ‘alg_algaeExternalLabDataPerSample’ that contains ‘Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University’ in the ‘laboratoryName’ field underwent acid fumigation prior to analysis.
