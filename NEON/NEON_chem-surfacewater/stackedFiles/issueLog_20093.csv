The proposed timeline for returning the analysis to normal operations did not did not meet NEON’s desired timeline for data return. Therefore, NEON moved the analysis of particulate carbon and nitrogen to a different laboratory.","Total particulate carbon and nitrogen analysis was transferred to another contracted external laboratory. Users can identify the change in external laboratory when the `swc_externalLabDataByAnalyte_pub:laboratoryName` field stops being populated as ‘EcoCore_CSU’ for the TPC and TPN analytes. NEON is now publishing particulate carbon and nitrogen concentration data from the ‘SIRFER Lab at University of Utah’. These data are also published in the Stable isotopes in surface water (DP1.20206.001) data product. For all previously released data, the particulate carbon and nitrogen data from SIRFER are now also published in the Chemical properties of surface water data product to provide a continuous data series. All particulate carbon and nitrogen data analyzed by EcoCore has been converted from units of ‘milligrams’ to ‘microgramsPerLiter’ to align with the units returned by SIRFER. Users should note that for a single parent sample, total particulate carbon (TPC) and nitrogen (TPN) may be published from both EcoCore and SIRFER. Inherent heterogeneity in stream water particulates from different samples and differences in sample collection, handling, shipment, and processing may cause differences in concentrations returned from the two labs for samples with the same parentSampleID."

Therefore, a new sample collection and laboratory analysis procedure was put in place. Starting the summer of 2019, samples for nitrate plus nitrate as nitrogen, nitrate as nitrogen, ammonium as nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus, and total dissolved phosphorus are collected, filtered (for nitrate plus nitrate as nitrogen, nitrate as nitrogen, ammonium as nitrogen, and orthophosphate), and both raw and filtered samples are frozen for preservation. Samples are then shipped to the laboratory frozen, stored frozen, thawed, and analyzed within 48 hours using methods with lower detection limits (> 90 % of NEON water chemistry samples are expected to be above these lower detection limits). Shipments of the frozen samples began 6/1/2021 and will proceed with approximately quarterly shipments in the future.","Nitrate plus nitrate as nitrogen, nitrate as nitrogen, ammonium as nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus, and total dissolved phosphorus are now being analyzed from frozen filtered and raw samples collected at the same time as other samples for water chemistry analysis."
