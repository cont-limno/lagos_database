Notes on linking NLA lakes, 26 SE 22 by K. Webster

****APPROACH:
1. Used Nicole's script edited by KEW for NLA lakes: NLA_site_match_to_lagos.R 

2. ss: Linked sample sites using file generated by Noah Lottig: nla_sites_updated_NL_15SE22 which was then edited to include site names to lagos_NLA_all_EDITED_16SE22.csv
	NAMES field was brought in from earlier version on GITHUB Final_NLA_Sites.csv; note all sites matched.

3. lc: An earlier run on 23AU was based on NLA's lake centroids (note NLA lake polygons != LAGOS polys); used those matches in updated criteria

4. Created criteria to use for assessment.
	a. criteria_ss and criteria_lc to indicate whether a match was within lake poly (0m) within 10m, within 100m or a mismatch
	b. idmatch compared linked lagoslakeids with match:ss=lc matched and mismatch:ss!=lc
	c. sharedwords_newss or _newlc not NA indicated NAMES_SS or NAMES_LC shared words with lake_namelagos of the linked lagoslakeid
	d. NOTE some deviations from Nicole's criteria which for 100m link only retained those with shared words in the names. I loosened that as described below.

****DECISIONS ON LINKING=Y: n=3489 out of 3666
1. 3438 sites had a 0m lonk and were all retained

2. 20 (of 22) sites had a 10m link with no mismatches with lc AND no missing name or non shared name

3. 29 (of 35) had a 100m link AND had matching linked lagoslakedids with lc. All but 2 of these had shared names with either a name or missing name; 
	(a) one (NLA17_GA-10001) was a visit 2 site where, despite name non match, visit 2 and the lc all linked to the same lagoslakeid.
	(b) second didn't have a name shared for either (NAMES = missing) BUT lc was linked using 0m criteria so considered a good match.


****DECISIONS ON LINKING=N: n=177 out of 3666
1. 169 lakes did not link to any lagos lake

2. 2 sites linked at 10m but did not match the lc lagoslakeid and either had a mismatched name OR missing name

3. 6 sites linked at 100m 
	(a) 4 had mismatches with lc lagoslakeid and shared words were either different or lake was unnamed.
	(b) 2 had matches with lc lagoslakeid but lake was unnamed AND lc link was at 100m

****FILES to use
1. NLA_LakeLink_FINAL_26SE22.csv has the final list to use for postgrs upload
2. nla_linked_final_all_23SE22.csv has the final list plus the information used to follow keep criteria.
3. R script is NLA_site_match_to_lagos.R

*****OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
1. NLA polygons are not the same as LAGOS polygons because different versions of the NHD were used. LAGOS polygons include some that were larger lakes subdivided.
2. NLA lakes include lakes < 1 ha.
